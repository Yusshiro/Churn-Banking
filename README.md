# 📊 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave the bank) using various machine learning techniques. It leverages real-world data and multiple modeling approaches to evaluate prediction performance.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `botswana_bank_customer_churn.csv`: Main dataset containing customer information and churn labels.
- `Churn.ipynb`: General notebook for data analysis and modeling.
- `Project_Naive_demo.ipynb`: Naive Bayes model implementation.
- `Project_SVM_Final.ipynb`: Final SVM model with preprocessing and evaluation.
- `churn_banking.ipynb` & `churn_banking_finnal.ipynb`: Additional notebooks for experimentation.
- `K-means.txt`: Notes and results on customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
- `output.png`: Visual output of model results or data analysis charts.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- **Naive Bayes**: A simple yet effective model assuming feature independence.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier for linear and non-linear data.
- **K-means Clustering**: Unsupervised technique to segment customers based on behavioral patterns.

## 📈 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding variable distributions and relationships through visualizations.
3. **Model Training**: Applying machine learning models and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC to assess performance.
5. **Customer Segmentation** *(Optional)*: Using K-means to group similar customer profiles.
